# NoirVision - Test Results & Verification

## Latest Update: Transcript Endpoint Fixed ✅

**Date:** February 15, 2026

**Issue Resolved:** The TwelveLabs `/generate` endpoint was returning a 404 error.

**Root Cause:** The code was using the wrong endpoint. TwelveLabs API v1.3 uses `/analyze` for open-ended text generation, not `/generate`.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed endpoint from `/v1.3/generate` to `/v1.3/analyze`
- Updated request format to match TwelveLabs API specification
- Added proper response parsing for the analyze endpoint format
- The response structure is: `{ "id": "...", "data": "text content", "finish_reason": "...", "usage": {...} }`

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Endpoint now returns 200 OK
- ✅ Successfully generates transcript analysis
- ✅ Correctly identifies videos with no spoken dialogue
- ✅ Example: "The video contains no spoken words or dialogue..." (476 chars)

**Impact:** All transcript-based features now work correctly, improving the quality of credibility reports.

## Detailed Analysis Output

### Video Evidence Detected by TwelveLabs:

1. **Yellow Bus (Mears)** - Crossing intersection (00:00:00)
2. **White Truck with Green Container** - Crossing (00:00:11)
3. **White Van** - Crossing (00:00:11)
4. **Black SUV** - Crossing (00:00:27)
5. **Black Pickup Truck** - Crossing (00:00:27)
6. **Multiple cars** - Red, black, dark-colored vehicles throughout

### Backboard AI Comparison Results:

| Category | Match | Explanation |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Time Match | ✗ | No specific time in claim |
| Location Match | ✓ | Video shows road/intersection |
| Suspect Description | ✗ | No suspects in claim |
| Weapon Match | ✓ | No weapons mentioned or shown |
| Event Sequence | ✓ | Cars moving on road confirmed |

### Verdict Reasoning:

**Score: 60/100 (Supported with minor discrepancy)**

The claim "Only cars moving on the road" is generally supported by the video evidence, which shows multiple vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, vans) moving through an intersection. However:

- ✅ **Location confirmed**: Video shows vehicles on a road
- ✅ **Event confirmed**: Multiple vehicles are moving
- ⚠️ **Accuracy note**: The video shows not just cars, but also buses, trucks, and vans
- ⚠️ **Missing details**: No specific time or location details in claim

**Detective's Note:** 
> "The tape told its own story, clear as a shot of bourbon in a smoky dive, yet the dame's account was missing a few details like a gambler's luck. Three matches out of five ain't a winning hand, but in this gritty game, sometimes you settle for scraps when the truth dances just out of reach."
